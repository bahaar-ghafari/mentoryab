# Project Folder Structure

We use Atomic Design:

- **components/**: UI components
  - **atoms/**: Basic elements
  - **molecules/**: Combined elements
  - **organisms/**: Complex sections

# Fetching Data

In this project, we use **React Query** for efficient data fetching, caching, and background updates. React Query is a powerful library that simplifies data fetching and state management in React applications. Instead of manually handling API requests, loading states, and caching, React Query does all of this automatically.


# Unit Test

Unit testing is the process of testing individual components of the code (like functions or methods) to ensure they work as expected. It helps catch bugs early, improves code quality, and makes future changes safer.
