# Fetching Data

In this project, we use **React Query** for efficient data fetching, caching, and background updates.
React Query simplifies data fetching and caching in React apps, reducing the need for manual state handling.


# Unit Test

Unit testing is the process of testing individual components of the code (like functions or methods) to ensure they work as expected. It helps catch bugs early, improves code quality, and makes future changes safer.


Mentoryab uses **Tailwind CSS**, **Material UI**, and **Styled Components** to create a highly flexible and responsive UI for building web applications.
